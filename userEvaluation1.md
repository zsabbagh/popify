# User Evaluation - prototype phase

For this user evaluation, the purpose was to find out the
needs and wants of users within the target group. 

At this stage, the project idea was to provide statistics,
recommendations and customized quizzes.

Firstly, a user within the target group was interviewed, 
only knowing the web app was supposed to use the Spotify
API. The purpose of the interview was to get an overview
of possible functionalities, based on unbiased opinions.

Secondly, the idea and prototype was presented to the 
user. The user tried the limited prototype, and gave 
feedback. Its functionality and content was discussed 
with the user, and the given feedback is stated below. 

The sessions were recorded, and the result is as follows:

## Interview
1. Are there any features you wish Spotify had?

        Possibility to search for songs after selecting
        artist, and finding concerts based on location.

2.  Are there things with spotify you think are unnecessary? 

        Does not like that it is possible to buy merge,
        but can see why it is useful for artists and
        fun for fans. There are other platforms for it.

3. How often do you read about the artists and albums on 
Spotify?

        Sometimes, would say 3 times per month.

4. Do you find it interesting to look at your listening 
statistics, such as most listened artist and top songs?

        Yes! Enjoys "Spotify Wrapped" a lot.

5. Do you like the recommendation function on spotify?
Do you find it accurate? Do you find it personal? 

        The recommendations are quite good, but it would
        be nice to be able to get more specific songs,
        based on specified selections. Sometimes it is 
        really good, but sometimes there is a wish for
        a specific vibe, but it is hard to get Spotify
        to generate it through "radio"-function, since
        it is unsure what the algorithm is based on.

        The daily playlists are nice since they provide
        a range of artists, and mix in some new songs.

6. Would you be interested in taking quizzes to test your
knowledge on the tracks and artist you listen to most?

        Could be fun. Would take a quiz provided with
        the "Spotify Wrapped". It could be fun to do 
        with friends and compare results.

## User feedback on prototype
1. The statistics and recommendations could be seperated 
from the quizzes, since it seems like two different ideas.
2. User wants to be able to search for music as well. 
3. Could be fun to see how the users top items relates
to other users.

## Addressed issues
- The quizzes were removed completely from the project,
since user, and later also the group, thinks it is better
to focus on one specific functionality.
- A search was implemented, both general search, and 
within the users top items as a filtration.
- Rating was added to the item cards, to give the user
an idea of how others listen, and give a feeling of
community.
- Review functionality was added, to provide the user with
a possibility to track what they like and dislike.
- Recommendation page makes it possible for user to select
both artists and tracks to generate recommendations from.
