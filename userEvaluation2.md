# User Evaluation 2

For this user evaluation, the user was asked to browse
to popify.se and explore the page, while thinking aloud.
The session was recorded, and its content presented in
the bullets below.

## Problems
- The user found the "add to playlist"-button after 16 minutes
- The user pressed "get recommendations" without selecting artists
or tracks
- The user selected 5 tracks, but did not press "get recommendations" - 
no new recommendations were fetched
- The user created a new playlist with a costumed name, but could not
find the new playlist in the list in a second try
- The user added recommendations to a playlist called "New Playlist",
which adds the songs to an already existing playlist with the same name.
- The search results are changed if the page is updated
- Search for genre is not possible
- The "welcome"-page is not shown if the user has been logged in before

## User feedback
- Would like more of top songs to select for recommendations
- 

## Addressed issues
- To be added
